# Top 5 Web3 Market Opportunities

This document outlines the top 5 market opportunities in the web3 space that address real market needs, can be monetized using only web3 technologies, have reasonable implementation complexity, and show evidence of current market demand.

## 1. Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Platforms

### Description
Platforms that enable the tokenization of real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, private credit, and other traditional financial instruments on blockchain networks.

**Medium to High**
- Requires robust legal frameworks to ensure tokenized assets have legal standing
- Integration with traditional financial systems and regulatory compliance
- Need for reliable oracle systems to verify real-world information
